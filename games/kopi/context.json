Below is a basic example of a text-based adventure game that mimics the style of classic point-and-click games like \"Police Quest.\" \n\nThis example includes a simple storyline, choices for the player, and basic navigation. You can expand upon this foundation to create a more complex game.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Police Quest Clone</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            background-color: #f0f0f0;\n            color: #333;\n            margin: 0;\n            padding: 20px;\n        }\n        #game {\n            background: white;\n            border: 1px solid #ccc;\n            padding: 20px;\n            border-radius: 5px;\n            box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n        }\n        h1 {\n            text-align: center;\n        }\n        .choice {\n            margin: 10px 0;\n        }\n        button {\n            padding: 10px;\n            font-size: 16px;\n            cursor: pointer;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"game\">\n        <h1>Police Quest Clone</h1>\n        <p id=\"story\">You are a rookie police officer on your first day.
