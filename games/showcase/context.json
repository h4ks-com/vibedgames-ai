      "content": "Certainly! Below is a simple HTML template that creates a showcase app for games from the specified API. The app will display games in an iframe, switching between them every 5 seconds after fetching a list of games from the API.\n\nHereâ€™s how the code is structured:\n1. HTML for the basic layout.\n2. CSS for basic styling.\n3. JavaScript to fetch games, select random ones, and switch them in the iframe.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Game Showcase</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            display: flex;\n            justify-content: center;\n            align-items: center;\n            height: 100vh;\n            margin: 0;\n            background-color: #282c34;\n            color: white;\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n        }\n        iframe {\n            border: none;\n            width: 80%;\n            height: 80%;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <iframe id=\"game-frame\" src=\"\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n    <script>\n        const iframe = document.getElementById('game-frame');\n        let games = [];\n        const switchInterval = 5000; // 5 seconds\n\n        // Function to fetch games from the API\n        async function fetchGames() {\n            const responses = await Promise.all([1, 2, 3].map(page => \n                fetch(`https://games.h4ks.com/api/games?sort_by=date_added&page=${page}`).then(res => res.json())\n            ));\n            games = responses.flatMap(response => response.data);\n            startShowcase();\n        }\n\n        // Function to start showcasing games\n        function startShowcase() {\n            if (games.length > 0) {\n                setInterval(() => {\n                    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * games.length);\n                    const game = games[randomIndex];\n                    if (game && game.url) {\n                        iframe.src = game.url;\n                    }\n                }, switchInterval);\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Fetch games once the page loads\n        window.onload = fetchGames;\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The HTML structure includes an `<iframe>` to display the games.\n- The CSS styles the body and the iframe to center the content and provides a dark background.\n- The JavaScript fetches games from the API, combining responses from pages 1 to 3. Adjust the number of pages if needed.\n- The game URL is extracted from the response and the iframe's source is updated every 5 seconds with a randomly selected game URL.\n\n### Usage:\n- Save the code to an HTML file (e.g., `games_showcase.html`).\n- Open the file in a web browser, and it will start showcasing the games automatically.\n\nFeel free to modify the page count or styles according to your needs!"
