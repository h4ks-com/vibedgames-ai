      "content": "Creating a Minecraft bot that connects to a server like `mc.h4ks.com` on port `65535` requires a significant amount of code and the use of specific libraries that are not typically supported in a web environment due to security restrictions. However, I can provide you with a simple HTML template that demonstrates how you might structure a web app for connecting to a Minecraft server using JavaScript.\n\nPlease note that this example will not actually connect to a Minecraft server, as that requires a dedicated environment and libraries like `mineflayer` or similar, which cannot be run directly in a browser. Instead, this example will show you how to set up a basic HTML structure with embedded CSS and JavaScript.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Minecraft Bot</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            background-color: #f0f0f0;\n            color: #333;\n            text-align: center;\n            padding: 50px;\n        }\n        #connectButton {\n            padding: 10px 20px;\n            font-size: 16px;\n            cursor: pointer;\n            background-color: #4CAF50;\n            color: white;\n            border: none;\n            border-radius: 5px;\n        }\n        #status {\n            margin-top: 20px;\n            font-size: 18px;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Minecraft Bot Connection</h1>\n    <button id=\"connectButton\">Connect to mc.h4ks.com:65535</button>\n    <div id=\"status\"></div>\n\n    <script>\n        document.getElementById('connectButton').addEventListener('click', function() {\n            // This is where you would implement the connection logic\n            // For demonstration purposes, we'll just simulate a connection attempt\n            const statusDiv = document.getElementById('status');\n            statusDiv.textContent = 'Connecting to mc.h4ks.com on port 65535...';\n\n            // Simulate a connection attempt\n            setTimeout(() => {\n                // Simulate a successful connection\n                statusDiv.textContent = 'Connected successfully!';\n            }, 2000);\n        });\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **HTML Structure**: The HTML contains a button to initiate the connection and a div to display the connection status.\n- **CSS Styles**: Basic styles are applied to make the app look decent.\n- **JavaScript Logic**: When the button is clicked, it simulates a connection attempt and updates the status after a delay.\n\n### Important Note:\nThis code does not actually connect to a Minecraft server. To create a real Minecraft bot, you would typically use Node.js with libraries like `mineflayer`, which cannot be executed in a browser environment. If you want to create a real bot, you would need to set up a Node.js server and run the bot there."
