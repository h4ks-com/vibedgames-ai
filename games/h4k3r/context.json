      "content": "Here's a simple HTML file that will display the text \"h4k3r\" in the center of the page in a large font size. After 3 seconds, it will redirect the user to the `/hello` path. You can just copy the entire code into an HTML file and open it in a web browser.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Redirect Example</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            display: flex;\n            justify-content: center;\n            align-items: center;\n            height: 100vh;\n            margin: 0;\n            background-color: #282c34;\n            color: white;\n            font-size: 10em; /* Very big font size */\n            text-align: center;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"message\">h4k3r</div>\n    <script>\n        // Wait for 3 seconds (3000 milliseconds) before redirecting\n        setTimeout(function() {\n            window.location.href = '/hello';\n        }, 3000);\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **HTML Structure**: The document includes basic HTML structure and includes the necessary `<head>` and `<body>` tags.\n2. **CSS Styles**: The CSS styles center the text both vertically and horizontally on the page and set a large font size. The background color and text color are also defined.\n3. **JavaScript Redirect**: The JavaScript uses `setTimeout` to redirect to `/hello` after a 3-second delay. \n\nJust save the code in an `index.html` file (or any filename with `.html` extension) and open it in your web browser to see it in action!"
