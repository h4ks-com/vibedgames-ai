It waits for 3 seconds before redirecting to the `/h4k3r` path on the same base URL. You can copy and paste this code into an HTML file and open it in a web browser.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Redirecting Page</title>\n    <style>\n        body, html {\n            height: 100%;\n            display: flex;\n            align-items: center;\n            justify-content: center;\n            margin: 0;\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            background-color: #f0f0f0;\n        }\n        .big-text {\n            font-size: 100px; /* Adjust this value for bigger/smaller text */\n            color: #333;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"big-text\">hello</div>\n    <script>\n        setTimeout(function() {\n            window.location.href = '/h4k3r';\n        }, 3000);\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **HTML Structure**: The structure consists of basic HTML elements including a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, `<head>` for meta tags and styles, and a `<body>` for the content.\n- **CSS Styling**:\n  - The `body` and `html` elements are styled to use full height, center the content, and have a light background color.\n  - The `.big-text` class is used to display the \"hello\" text in a very large font size.\n- **JavaScript**: The `setTimeout` function redirects the user to `/h4k3r` after 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds).\n\nFeel free to modify the font size, color, or background as you see fit!"
