      "content": "Creating a simple 3D game that connects to an IRC server and generates rooms based on channel lists is quite an ambitious task. Below is a basic structure of a web application using Three.js to create a 3D environment, connect to an IRC server over TLS WebSocket, retrieve the channel list, and create rooms accordingly. This example provides a very basic framework; for a production-level application, you would need to add more functionality, error handling, and styling.\n\nHere's a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>3D IRC Rooms</title>\n    <style>\n        body { margin: 0; overflow: hidden; }\n        canvas { display: block; }\n        #info { position: absolute; top: 10px; left: 10px; color: white; z-index: 10; }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"info\">Connecting...</div>\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n        const scene = new THREE.Scene();\n        const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);\n        const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true });\n        renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);\n        document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);\n\n        const infoDiv = document.getElementById('info');\n\n        let ws;\n        function connectIRC() {\n            ws = new WebSocket('wss://irc.h4ks.com:8097');\n            ws.onopen = () => {\n                infoDiv.innerText = 'Connected, sending LIST command...';\n                ws.send('NICK web_user\\nUSER web_user 0 * :web_user\\nLIST');\n            };\n\n            ws.onmessage = (event) => {\n                const response = event.data;\n                if (response.includes('353')) {\n                    const lines = response.split('\\n');\n                    generateRooms(lines.filter(line => line.startsWith('#')));\n                }\n            };\n\n            ws.onclose = () => {\n                infoDiv.innerText = 'Disconnected from IRC';\n            };\n        }\n\n        function generateRooms(channels) {\n            channels.forEach((channel, index) => {\n                const roomSize = 1; // Size of each room\n                const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(roomSize, roomSize, roomSize);\n                const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: Math.random() * 0xffffff });\n                const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);\n\n                cube.position.x = (index % 5) * 1.5;\n                cube.position.y = 0.5;\n                cube.position.z = Math.floor(index / 5) * 1.5;\n\n                cube.userData.channel = channel;\n                scene.add(cube);\n            });\n        }\n\n        function animate() {\n            requestAnimationFrame(animate);\n            renderer.render(scene, camera);\n        }\n\n        function onWindowResize() {\n            camera.aspect = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight;\n            camera.updateProjectionMatrix();\n            renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);\n        }\n\n        window.addEventListener('resize', onWindowResize);\n\n        camera.position.z = 5;\n        connectIRC();\n        animate();\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Three.js** is utilized for rendering a simple 3D environment.\n- A WebSocket connection is established to the specified IRC server using the `wss://` protocol.\n- The \"LIST\" command is sent to retrieve the available channels.\n- Rooms (cubes) are generated in the 3D world for each channel, each with a random color.\n- The basic infrastructure for connectivity and room generation is set up; however, more functionality to join and leave channels based on user proximity is needed.\n- Note that running this code would require a WebSocket server that is configured for IRC communication, and the server URL provided (irc.h4ks.com) should allow WebSocket connections.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n- Be cautious with WebSocket connections, particularly when it comes to security, authentication, and rate limits.\n- The implementation is minimal and may need further features like actual chat, movement in the 3D space, or interactions for a complete gaming experience.\n- Ensure that the server URL (`irc.h4ks.com`) is reachable and that WebSocket connections are enabled on that server. \n\nThis example code serves as a starter template; you can expand upon it based on your requirements."
