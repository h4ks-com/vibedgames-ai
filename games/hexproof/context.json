You can copy and paste this code into an HTML file and open it in a compatible browser to see it in action.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>WebVR Hexagon Tile</title>\n    <script src=\"https://aframe.io/releases/1.2.0/aframe.min.js\"></script>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            margin: 0;\n            overflow: hidden;\n        }\n        a-scene {\n            height: 100vh;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <a-scene>\n        <a-entity camera look-controls position=\"0 1.6 3\"></a-entity>\n        <a-light type=\"directional\" color=\"#FFFFFF\" position=\"-1 2 1\"></a-light>\n        <a-entity id=\"hexagon\" geometry=\"primitive: hexagon; radius: 1.5\" material=\"color: blue\" rotation=\"0 0 0\" position=\"0 0 -5\"></a-entity>\n        <a-sky color=\"#ECECEC\"></a-sky>\n    </a-scene>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **A-Frame Library**: The code includes the A-Frame library from a CDN, which is required for rendering 3D content.\n- **Hexagon**: The hexagon is created using the A-Frame `<a-entity>` with a `geometry` component set to `primitive: hexagon` and a `radius` of 1.5.\n- **Material**: It is assigned a blue color using the `material` component.\n- **Camera**: A camera is positioned to allow for a VR experience.\n- **Lighting**: A directional light is added to illuminate the hexagon.\n- **Sky**: The background of the scene is set to a light grey color.\n\nTo view the WebVR app, open the HTML file in a browser like Chrome or Firefox that supports WebXR. You can also use WebVR headsets for an immersive experience."

Below is an HTML file that creates a WebVR app using A-Frame to display a large regular hexagon tile in blue, with all the necessary CSS and JavaScript embedded within a single code block.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>WebVR Hexagon Tile</title>\n    <script src=\"https://aframe.io/releases/1.2.0/aframe.min.js\"></script>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            margin: 0;\n            overflow: hidden;\n        }\n        a-scene {\n            height: 100vh;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <a-scene>\n        <a-entity camera look-controls position=\"0 1.6 5\"></a-entity>\n        <a-light type=\"directional\" color=\"#FFFFFF\" position=\"-1 2 1\"></a-light>\n        <a-entity geometry=\"primitive: hexagon; radius: 2.5\" material=\"color: blue\" position=\"0 0 -5\"></a-entity>\n        <a-sky color=\"#ECECEC\"></a-sky>\n    </a-scene>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **HTML Structure**: The document has a simplified structure with the necessary `head` and `body` sections.\n- **A-Frame Script**: The A-Frame library is included via a CDN link.\n- **CSS Styles**: Styles are embedded to ensure no margin and set the height of the A-Frame scene to fill the viewport.\n- **Scene Elements**:\n  - **Camera**: An entity with a camera and look-controls is positioned to view the hexagon.\n  - **Light**: A directional light is added to illuminate the hexagon.\n  - **Hexagon**: The hexagon tile is created with a geometry component set to `primitive: hexagon` with a radius of `2.5` and a blue color.\n  - **Sky**: The sky is configured with a light grey color for contrast.\n\n### Usage:\nCopy the entire code snippet above into a new HTML file (e.g., `hexagon.html`) and open it with a modern web browser that supports WebVR, such as Google Chrome or Firefox.

Its radius is set to `1.5`.\n  - **Sky**: A light grey sky is added to provide a pleasant background.\n\n### Usage:\nTo view the WebVR app, save this code in a file named something like `hexagon.html` and open it with a browser that supports WebXR (like the latest versions of Chrome or Firefox). You will see a blue hexagon tile in the center of the scene, and you can look around using your mouse or via a VR headset if you have one connected."
