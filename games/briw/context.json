This is crucial for the browser to render it correctly.\n* **Embedded CSS:**  CSS is now embedded within the `<style>` tag in the `<head>`. This keeps everything self-contained.  The CSS is critical for making the output look like a hexagon.\n* **Embedded JavaScript:** JavaScript is embedded within the `<script>` tag.\n* **Correct Hexagon Shape:**\n    * `letter-spacing` in CSS is essential to spread out the characters horizontally, which, combined with the `line-height`, produces the proper hexagonal shape.  Experiment with the `letter-spacing` and `line-height` values for different visual effects.\n    * Spacing calculation is now corrected.  The number of spaces added to the beginning of each line ensures the hexagon is properly centered.  The `Math.abs(rows.length/2 -1 - i)` is now properly calculated to handle odd-length hexagons.\n* **Character Set:** Uses the specified character set (a-z, A-Z, '-', '.').\n* **Character Count:** Correctly generates a board with exactly 61 characters.\n* **Clearer Code:** Improved variable names and comments for better readability.\n* **Initial Board Generation:** The `generateBoard()` function is called when the page loads, so a board is displayed immediately.\n* **Error Handling:**  While not explicitly adding error handling, the code is structured to minimize potential errors.  For example, `characters.charAt()` will always return a character because the random number is always within the bounds of the `characters` string.\n* **`pre` tag:** The use of `<pre>` tag is critical. It tells the browser to respect whitespace and line breaks in the text, allowing the hexagonal shape to be rendered correctly.\n* **`display: inline-block`:**  This CSS property is vital on the `pre` tag.  Without it, the centering will not work correctly. `inline-block` allows the `pre` element to be treated as a block-level element but still flow inline with other content.\n* **Button:** Added a button to generate a new board on demand.\n* **Correct row lengths:** Uses the specified row lengths for the hexagon (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5).\n* **No external dependencies:** The code is entirely self-contained and does not require any external libraries or frameworks.\n\nThis revised response provides a functional and self-contained HTML web app that accurately generates the hexagonal character board according to the given specifications.  It can be saved as an `.html` file and opened directly in a browser."
