      "content": "Creating a simple Agar.io clone with smooth character movement and mouse direction changes can be done using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below is a complete example that you can copy and paste into a single HTML file. This code creates a basic game where a circle (representing the player) follows the mouse cursor smoothly.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Agar.io Clone</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            margin: 0;\n            overflow: hidden;\n            background-color: #f0f0f0;\n        }\n        #gameCanvas {\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            background-color: #ffffff;\n            border: 1px solid #000;\n        }\n        .player {\n            position: absolute;\n            border-radius: 50%;\n            background-color: #3498db;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <canvas id=\"gameCanvas\"></canvas>\n    <div class=\"player\" id=\"player\" style=\"width: 30px; height: 30px;\"></div>\n\n    <script>\n        const canvas = document.getElementById('gameCanvas');\n        const player = document.getElementById('player');\n        const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');\n\n        let canvasWidth = window.innerWidth;\n        let canvasHeight = window.innerHeight;\n        canvas.width = canvasWidth;\n        canvas.height = canvasHeight;\n\n        let playerX = canvasWidth / 2;\n        let playerY = canvasHeight / 2;\n        const playerSize = 30;\n        const speed = 0.1; // Adjust speed for smoothness\n\n        let mouseX = playerX;\n        let mouseY = playerY;\n\n        // Update player position based on mouse position\n        function updatePlayerPosition() {\n            const dx = mouseX - playerX;\n            const dy = mouseY - playerY;\n            const distance = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);\n\n            if (distance > 1) {\n                playerX += dx / distance * speed;\n                playerY += dy / distance * speed;\n            }\n\n            player.style.left = `${playerX}px`;\n            player.style.top = `${playerY}px`;\n        }\n\n        // Draw the game\n        function draw() {\n            ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvasWidth, canvasHeight);\n            ctx.fillStyle = '#3498db';\n            ctx.beginPath();\n            ctx.arc(playerX, playerY, playerSize / 2, 0, Math.PI * 2);\n            ctx.fill();\n        }\n\n        // Main game loop\n        function gameLoop() {\n            updatePlayerPosition();\n            draw();\n            requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);\n        }\n\n        // Mouse move event\n        window.addEventListener('mousemove', (event) => {\n            mouseX = event.clientX;\n            mouseY = event.clientY;\n        });\n\n        // Start the game loop\n        gameLoop();\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **HTML Structure**: The HTML consists of a `<canvas>` element for drawing and a `<div>` for the player character.\n- **CSS Styles**: Basic styles are applied to the body and the player character to make it circular and give it a background color.\n- **JavaScript Logic**:\n  - The canvas is set to the full window size.\n  - The player's position is updated based on the mouse's position, with a smooth transition.\n  - The game loop continuously updates the player's position and redraws the player on the canvas.\n  - The mouse movement is tracked using an event listener.\n\n### Usage:\n1. Copy the code above.\n2. Paste it into a new file and save it with a `.html` extension (e.g., `agar_clone.html`).\n3. Open the file in a web browser to see the game in action. The blue circle will follow your mouse cursor smoothly."
