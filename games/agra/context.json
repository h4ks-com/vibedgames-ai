      "content": "Creating a simple clone of Agar.io in a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript is a challenging task, but we can create a very simplified version that captures the essence of the original game. This basic version will let players control a cell that can grow by eating smaller cells. Hereâ€™s a simple implementation:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Agar.io Clone</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            margin: 0;\n            overflow: hidden;\n            background-color: #fafafa;\n        }\n        canvas {\n            display: block;\n            background-color: #e0e0e0;\n            border: 1px solid #333;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <canvas id=\"gameCanvas\"></canvas>\n    <script>\n        const canvas = document.getElementById('gameCanvas');\n        const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');\n        canvas.width = window.innerWidth;\n        canvas.height = window.innerHeight;\n\n        let player = {\n            x: canvas.width / 2,\n            y: canvas.height / 2,\n            radius: 20,\n            color: 'blue'\n        };\n\n        let food = [];\n        for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\n            food.push({\n                x: Math.random() * canvas.width,\n                y: Math.random() * canvas.height,\n                radius: 5\n            });\n        }\n\n        function drawPlayer() {\n            ctx.beginPath();\n            ctx.arc(player.x, player.y, player.radius, 0, Math.PI * 2);\n            ctx.fillStyle = player.color;\n            ctx.fill();\n            ctx.closePath();\n        }\n\n        function drawFood() {\n            ctx.fillStyle = 'green';\n            food.forEach(item => {\n                ctx.beginPath();\n                ctx.arc(item.x, item.y, item.radius, 0, Math.PI * 2);\n                ctx.fill();\n                ctx.closePath();\n            });\n        }\n\n        function update() {\n            ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);\n            drawFood();\n            drawPlayer();\n\n            for (let i = food.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n                const dx = player.x - food[i].x;\n                const dy = player.y - food[i].y;\n                const distance = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);\n\n                if (distance < player.radius + food[i].radius) {\n                    food.splice(i, 1);\n                    player.radius += 1; // Grow the player when it eats food\n                }\n            }\n\n            requestAnimationFrame(update);\n        }\n\n        function resizeCanvas() {\n            canvas.width = window.innerWidth;\n            canvas.height = window.innerHeight;\n            player.x = canvas.width / 2;\n            player.y = canvas.height / 2;\n        }\n\n        window.addEventListener('resize', resizeCanvas);\n        window.addEventListener('mousemove', (event) => {\n            const rect = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();\n            const mouseX = event.clientX - rect.left;\n            const mouseY = event.clientY - rect.top;\n\n            const angle = Math.atan2(mouseY - player.y, mouseX - player.x);\n            player.x += Math.cos(angle) * 5; // Move toward the mouse with a constant speed\n            player.y += Math.sin(angle) * 5;\n        });\n\n        update();\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Instructions to Run the Code\n1. Copy the above code into a text editor.\n2. Save the file as `agar_clone.html`.\n3. Open the file in a web browser.\n\n### Features of this Simple Clone:\n- A blue player cell that follows the mouse cursor.\n- Green food pellets appear randomly on the screen, which the player can \"eat\" to grow.\n- The player cell increases in size upon eating food.\n- Resizes when the browser window size changes.\n\n### Note:\nThis implementation is very basic and does not include multiplayer capabilities, advanced graphics, or other features of the original Agar.io game. For a full-featured version, you would need a back-end server, game mechanics, networking code, and much more complex logic. However, this should give you a starting point to understand how to create a simple canvas-based game."
