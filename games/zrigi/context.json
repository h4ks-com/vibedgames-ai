You can expand upon this foundation to create a more complex game.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Police Quest Clone</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            background-color: #f0f0f0;\n            color: #333;\n            margin: 0;\n            padding: 20px;\n        }\n        #game {\n            background: white;\n            border: 1px solid #ccc;\n            padding: 20px;\n            border-radius: 5px;\n            box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n        }\n        h1 {\n            text-align: center;\n        }\n        .choice {\n            margin: 10px 0;\n        }\n        button {\n            padding: 10px;\n            font-size: 16px;\n            cursor: pointer;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"game\">\n        <h1>Police Quest Clone</h1>\n        <p id=\"story\">You are a rookie police officer on your first day.

Copy the code above.\n2. Create a new text file and save it with a `.html` extension (for example, `cow_adventure.html`).\n3. Open the file with a web browser to play the game.\n\nThis simple adventure game allows you to navigate choices as the cow Bessie. You can expand upon this by adding more choices and scenes to create a richer storytelling experience!"
