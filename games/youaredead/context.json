Copy the above code into a text file.\n2. Save the file with a `.html` extension (e.g., `dead_mans_choices.html`).\n3. Open the file in a web browser.\n\n### Game Concept\n- The game is a text-based adventure where the player makes choices about the next steps they want to take after dying. \n- The choices lead to different endings, either finding peace or losing oneself. \n- At the end of any scenario, the player can restart the game.\n\nFeel free to modify and expand on the gameâ€™s choices and consequences! Enjoy!"
