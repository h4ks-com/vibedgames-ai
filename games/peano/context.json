The key axioms are:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>0 is a natural number.</li>\n    <li>Every natural number has a successor, which is also a natural number.</li>\n    <li>0 is not the successor of any natural number.</li>\n    <li>Different numbers have different successors.</li>\n    <li>If a property is possessed by 0 and also by the successor of every number that has that property, then it is possessed by all natural numbers (principle of induction).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Peano's work significantly contributed to the foundational aspects of mathematics and the formalization of number theory.\n</p>\n\n<div id=\"game-container\">\n    <h2>Simple Click Game: Count the Natural Numbers!</h2>\n    <div id=\"score\">Score: 0</div>\n    <button class=\"number\" onclick=\"incrementScore(1)\">1</button>\n    <button class=\"number\" onclick=\"incrementScore(2)\">2</button>\n    <button class=\"number\" onclick=\"incrementScore(3)\">3</button>\n    <button class=\"number\" onclick=\"incrementScore(4)\">4</button>\n    <button class=\"number\" onclick=\"incrementScore(5)\">5</button>\n</div>\n\n<script>\n    let score = 0;\n\n    function incrementScore(num) {\n        score += num;\n        document.getElementById('score').innerText = 'Score: ' + score;\n        if (score >= 15) {\n            alert(\"Congratulations!
