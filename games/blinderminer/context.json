      "content": "Creating a Minecraft client that connects to a Minecraft server using WebSockets and displays basic world information in HTML is a complex task. However, I can provide you with a simple example that demonstrates how to connect to a Minecraft server using WebSockets and display some basic information.\n\nPlease note that this example assumes that the server supports WebSocket connections and that you have the necessary permissions to connect to it. The Minecraft protocol is not natively WebSocket-based, so this example is more of a conceptual demonstration.\n\nHere's a simple HTML file that you can use:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Minecraft WebSocket Client</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            background-color: #f0f0f0;\n            color: #333;\n            padding: 20px;\n        }\n        h1 {\n            color: #4CAF50;\n        }\n        #output {\n            margin-top: 20px;\n            padding: 10px;\n            background-color: #fff;\n            border: 1px solid #ccc;\n            border-radius: 5px;\n            max-height: 300px;\n            overflow-y: auto;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Minecraft Server Query</h1>\n    <button id=\"connectBtn\">Connect to Server</button>\n    <div id=\"output\"></div>\n\n    <script>\n        const serverAddress = 'ws://mc.h4ks.com:25565'; // WebSocket address\n        const outputDiv = document.getElementById('output');\n\n        document.getElementById('connectBtn').addEventListener('click', () => {\n            const socket = new WebSocket(serverAddress);\n\n            socket.onopen = () => {\n                outputDiv.innerHTML += '<p>Connected to the server!</p>';\n                // Send a basic query (this is just an example, actual query may vary)\n                socket.send(JSON.stringify({ action: 'query' }));\n            };\n\n            socket.onmessage = (event) => {\n                const data = JSON.parse(event.data);\n                outputDiv.innerHTML += `<p>Server Response: ${JSON.stringify(data)}</p>`;\n            };\n\n            socket.onerror = (error) => {\n                outputDiv.innerHTML += `<p style=\"color: red;\">Error: ${error.message}</p>`;\n            };\n\n            socket.onclose = () => {\n                outputDiv.innerHTML += '<p>Disconnected from the server.</p>';\n            };\n        });\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **HTML Structure**: The HTML contains a button to connect to the server and a div to display output.\n- **CSS**: Basic styling is applied for better readability.\n- **JavaScript**: \n  - A WebSocket connection is established to the specified server address.\n  - When the connection is opened, a basic query is sent (you may need to adjust the query based on the server's API).\n  - Responses from the server are displayed in the output div.\n  - Error handling and connection close events are also managed.\n\n### Important Notes:\n1. **WebSocket Support**: Ensure that the Minecraft server supports WebSocket connections. Most Minecraft servers use TCP, and you may need a proxy or a specific server setup to handle WebSocket connections.\n2. **Security**: Be cautious when connecting to external servers, especially if you are sending sensitive information.\n3. **Functionality**: This example is very basic and may not work as intended without a proper WebSocket server implementation on the Minecraft side.\n\nYou can save this code in an HTML file and open it in a web browser to test the connection. Adjust the WebSocket URL and query as necessary based on your server's capabilities."
