The scene features a green floor with a black road.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Web VR Scene with A-Frame</title>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <script src=\"https://aframe.io/releases/1.2.0/aframe.min.js\"></script>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            margin: 0;\n            overflow: hidden;\n            background-color: #000; /* Background color for the body */\n        }\n        a-scene {\n            display: block; /* Ensure the scene takes whole viewport */\n        }\n        .road {\n            color: black;\n            height: 0.2;\n            width: 5;\n            depth: 100;\n            position: 0 0.1 0;\n        }\n        .floor {\n            color: green;\n            height: 0.1;\n            width: 100;\n            depth: 100;\n            position: 0 0 0;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <a-scene>\n        <a-entity class=\"floor\" geometry=\"primitive: box; width: 100; height: 0.1; depth: 100\" material=\"color: green\"></a-entity>\n        <a-entity class=\"road\" geometry=\"primitive: box; width: 5; height: 0.2; depth: 100\" material=\"color: black\" position=\"0 0.1 0\"></a-entity>\n        \n        <a-camera position=\"0 2 5\"></a-camera>\n        \n        <a-sky color=\"#87CEEB\"></a-sky> <!-- Sky color -->\n    </a-scene>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The structure of this HTML file includes both embedded CSS and JavaScript, making it self-contained.\n- The A-Frame library is loaded through a `<script>` tag from a CDN.\n- The floor is represented by a green box, while the road is a narrower black box positioned on top of the floor.\n- The camera is positioned slightly above the ground to give a clear view of the scene.\n- The sky is set to a light blue color to create a pleasant atmosphere.\n\nYou can copy the above code into an HTML file and open it in a browser that supports WebVR (like Chrome or Firefox). Make sure to use a VR headset for optimal experience, or you can also look around using your mouse."
