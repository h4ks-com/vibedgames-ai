      "content": "Creating a simple webpage that allows you to play a MIDI file is possible, but since I cannot access external links, I'll provide you with a complete HTML template. You can modify the MIDI file path in the code to match the sounds you would like to play and then run this HTML in your browser.\n\nHereâ€™s a self-contained HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>MIDI Player</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            background-color: #f4f4f4;\n            text-align: center;\n            padding: 50px;\n        }\n\n        h1 {\n            color: #333;\n        }\n\n        button {\n            background-color: #007BFF;\n            color: white;\n            border: none;\n            padding: 10px 20px;\n            text-align: center;\n            text-decoration: none;\n            display: inline-block;\n            font-size: 16px;\n            margin: 4px 2px;\n            cursor: pointer;\n            border-radius: 5px;\n        }\n\n        button:hover {\n            background-color: #0056b3;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>MIDI File Player</h1>\n    <button id=\"play-btn\">Play MIDI</button>\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/MidiPlayerJS/0.2.0/midi.player.min.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n        const player = new MidiPlayer.Player();\n\n        player.loadFile(\"your-midi-file.mid\"); // Change this to your MIDI file path\n\n        document.getElementById('play-btn').addEventListener('click', function() {\n            if (player.isPlaying()) {\n                player.pause();\n                this.textContent = 'Play MIDI';\n            } else {\n                player.play();\n                this.textContent = 'Pause MIDI';\n            }\n        });\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Replace `\"your-midi-file.mid\"` with the correct path to your MIDI file.\n2. Save the code into an HTML file (e.g., `midi_player.html`).\n3. Open the file in a web browser.\n\n### Note:\n- Ensure that the MIDI file you want to play is accessible from the same directory as your HTML file or provide the correct path if located elsewhere.\n- The MIDI file must be compatible with web MIDI player libraries, so ensure it is correctly formatted.\n- The MIDI Player library used in this example (MidiPlayerJS) is included via CDN, so there's no need to download it."
