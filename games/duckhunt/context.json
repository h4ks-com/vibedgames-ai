'left' : 'right';\n        if (direction === 'left') {\n          duck.style.right = '-50px';\n        } else {\n          duck.style.left = '-50px';\n        }\n        document.body.appendChild(duck);\n        setTimeout(() => {\n          duck.remove();\n          spawnDuck();\n        }, 5000);\n        duck.addEventListener('click', () => {\n          duck.remove();\n          points++;\n          score.textContent = `Score: ${points}`;\n        });\n        if (direction === 'left') {\n          duck.style.animation = 'moveLeft 5s forwards';\n        } else {\n          duck.style.animation = 'moveRight 5s forwards';\n        }\n      }\n\n      spawnDuck();\n\n      @keyframes moveLeft {\n        from {\n          right: -50px;\n        }\n        to {\n          right: 100%;\n        }\n      }\n      @keyframes moveRight {\n        from {\n          left: -50px;\n        }\n        to {\n          left: 100%;\n        }\n      }\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis code creates a simple game where ducks randomly spawn from the left or right side of the page and move across the screen. If the player clicks on a duck before it goes off-screen, they earn one point, which is displayed on the screen.\nNote that this code uses a publicly available image of a duck for demonstration purposes. In your own implementation, you may want to use your own image or find a different one that fits your needs."
