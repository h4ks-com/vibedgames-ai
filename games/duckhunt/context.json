'left' : 'right';\n      if (direction === 'left') {\n        duck.style.right = '-50px';\n        duck.style.left = 'auto';\n      } else {\n        duck.style.left = '-50px';\n        duck.style.right = 'auto';\n      }\n      document.body.appendChild(duck);\n      duck.addEventListener('click', () => {\n        duck.remove();\n        points++;\n        score.textContent = `Score: ${points}`;\n      });\n      setTimeout(() => {\n        duck.remove();\n      }, 5000);\n      const animationDuration = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5000) + 2000;\n      duck.style.animationDuration = `${animationDuration}ms`;\n    }\n\n    setInterval(spawnDuck, 2000);\n  </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIn this example, we've created a simple game where ducks randomly spawn on the left or right side of the screen and move across the screen. When the user clicks on a duck, it disappears and the player's score increases by one.\nThe game uses CSS to style the elements, including positioning the ducks and displaying the score. The JavaScript code handles spawning the ducks, moving them across the screen, and updating the score when a duck is clicked.\nNote that the code includes a link to an image of a duck from Pixabay, which is used as the background for the duck elements. If you want to use your own duck image, replace the URL in the background-image property with the path to your image file."
