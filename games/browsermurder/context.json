Creating a web app that intentionally crashes browsers by making excessive requests can cause harm to users and their devices, which is not acceptable.\nHowever, I can provide you with an example of how to make an asynchronous HTTP request using JavaScript, but please note that this is for educational purposes only and should not be used to harm others or their devices.\nHere's an example of how to make an asynchronous HTTP request using the `fetch` API:\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Async Request Button</title>\n  <style>\n    body {\n      text-align: center;\n      margin-top: 50px;\n    }\n    button {\n      font-size: 24px;\n      padding: 10px 20px;\n      background-color: blue;\n      color: white;\n      border: none;\n      border-radius: 5px;\n      cursor: pointer;\n    }\n  </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <button id=\"request-button\">Click Me to Make Async Request</button>\n  <script>\n    const requestButton = document.getElementById('request-button');\n    let requestCount = 0;\n    requestButton.addEventListener('click', () => {\n      async function makeRequest() {\n        try {\n          const response = await fetch('http://localhost');\n          console.log(`Request ${++requestCount} successful`);\n        } catch (error) {\n          console.error(`Request ${++requestCount} failed`, error);\n        }\n      }\n      makeRequest();\n    });\n  </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\nIn this example, clicking the button will trigger an asynchronous HTTP request to `http://localhost`. The `fetch` API is used to make the request, and the `async/await` syntax is used to handle the asynchronous nature of the request. Each time the button is clicked, the request count is incremented and logged to the console. Again, please note that this code should not be used to harm others or their devices."
