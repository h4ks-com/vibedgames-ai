Each word in the provided text will serve as a hyperlink to an appropriate Wikipedia page. For the purpose of this example, I'll create a simple version of a fan site about Hao Wang. \n\nYou can replace the example content with the actual content from the provided link if needed.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Hao Wang Fan Site</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            line-height: 1.6;\n            background-color: #f4f4f4;\n            margin: 0;\n            padding: 20px;\n        }\n        h1 {\n            color: #333;\n        }\n        a {\n            color: #007BFF;\n            text-decoration: none;\n        }\n        a:hover {\n            text-decoration: underline;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Hao Wang Fan Site</h1>\n    <p id=\"content\"></p>\n    <script>\n        // Content containing keywords\n        const content = `\n            Hao Wang was a Chinese-American mathematician and philosopher who made significant \n            contributions to mathematical logic and the philosophy of mathematics. He is known \n            for his work on computer science, particularly in the area of automated reasoning. \n            Wang also developed the \"Wang's tile\" concept, which is related to tiling theory. \n            His research has influenced various fields including artificial intelligence, \n            linguistics, and cognitive science.\n        `;\n\n        // Function to create hyperlinks for each word\n        function createHyperlinkedContent(text) {\n            const words = text.split(' ');\n            const hyperlinkedWords = words.map(word => {\n                // Generating a Wikipedia link (simple version, more complex logic can be used)\n                const formattedWord = word.replace(/[^a-zA-Z]/g, ''); // Clean punctuation\n                return `<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/${encodeURIComponent(formattedWord)}\" target=\"_blank\">${word}</a>`;\n            });\n            return hyperlinkedWords.join(' ');\n        }\n\n        // Populate the content\n        document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = createHyperlinkedContent(content);\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### How it Works:\n1. **HTML Structure**: The HTML contains a `head` section with embedded CSS for styling and a `body` section with a heading and a paragraph where the content will be displayed.\n\n2. **JavaScript Logic**: \n   - The JavaScript defines the `content` string with a brief overview of Hao Wang.\n   - The `createHyperlinkedContent` function splits the text into words and wraps each word with a hyperlink pointing to a corresponding Wikipedia page.\n   - The cleaned word is used to format the Wikipedia URL.\n\n3. **Dynamic Content**: The hyperlinks will open in a new tab when clicked due to `target=\"_blank\"`.\n\n### Usage:\nTo use it, simply copy and paste the above code into an HTML file and open it in a web browser. You can replace the content with the actual text you want to use for the Hao Wang fan site."
