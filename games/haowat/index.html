        // Content about Hao Wang and Wang Tiles

            Hao Wang was a Chinese-American mathematician and philosopher who made significant 
            contributions to mathematical logic and the philosophy of mathematics. He is known 
            for his work on computer science, particularly in the area of automated reasoning. 
            Wang also developed the "Wang's tile" concept, which is related to tiling theory and 
            consists of square tiles that must be placed on a plane in such a way that adjacent 
            edges have the same color. The problem of determining whether a given set of Wang 
            tiles can tile the plane, known as the "Wang Tile Problem," was proven to be undecidable. 
            This concept has implications in computer science, particularly in the fields of 
            computational theory and algorithm design, as it relates to questions of decidability 
            and complexity. Wang's work has influenced various fields including artificial intelligence, 
            linguistics, logic programming, and cognitive science. His ideas also extend into 
            mathematical puzzles and recreational mathematics, making the gameplay aspect of 
            Wang Tiles intriguing for both mathematicians and enthusiasts.
