      "content": "Sure! Below is a simple web game that teaches truth table logic through analogies with Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) spellcasting. The game is designed to be entirely in a single HTML file, with embedded CSS and JavaScript.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>D&D Spellcasting Logic Game</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            background-color: #f2f2f2;\n            color: #333;\n            text-align: center;\n            padding: 20px;\n        }\n        h1 {\n            color: #b30000;\n        }\n        button {\n            padding: 10px 20px;\n            margin: 10px;\n            font-size: 16px;\n            border: none;\n            border-radius: 5px;\n            cursor: pointer;\n            background-color: #4CAF50;\n            color: white;\n        }\n        button:hover {\n            background-color: #45a049;\n        }\n        .result {\n            margin-top: 20px;\n            font-size: 1.5em;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Spellcasting Logic Game</h1>\n    <p>Cast \"Fireball\" or \"Healing\" using the following spell combination:</p>\n    <p>\n        <label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"wizard\" /> Wizard (A)</label><br />\n        <label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cleric\" /> Cleric (B)</label><br />\n    </p>\n    <button onclick=\"castSpell()\">Cast Spell</button>\n    \n    <div class=\"result\" id=\"result\"></div>\n    \n    <script>\n        function castSpell() {\n            const wizard = document.getElementById('wizard').checked;\n            const cleric = document.getElementById('cleric').checked;\n            let result = 'Invalid Cast!';\n\n            if (wizard && cleric) {\n                result = 'You cast \"Fireball\" and receive \"Healing\"! (A AND B)';\n            } else if (wizard) {\n                result = 'You cast \"Fireball\"! (A)';\n            } else if (cleric) {\n                result = 'You receive \"Healing\"! (B)';\n            } else {\n                result = 'No spell cast! (NEITHER)';\n            }\n\n            document.getElementById('result').innerText = result;\n        }\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### How to Run the Game:\n1. Copy the entire code above.\n2. Paste it into a text editor and save the file with the `.html` extension (e.g., `dd_logic_game.html`).\n3. Open the file in a web browser.\n\n### Game Explanation:\n- The game presents the player with two characters from D&D: a Wizard (A) and a Cleric (B).\n- The player can check the boxes to select which spells they'd like to \"cast.\"\n- Depending on the combination of checked characters, the game will explain what spell was cast according to the rules of logic:\n  - If both are selected, the result represents the logical AND (A AND B).\n  - If only one is selected, it represents the individual casts.\n  - If neither is selected, it indicates no spell has been cast.\n\nThis way, players can learn about truth tables through a fun and engaging game!"
