      "content": "Creating a fully functional Minecraft Bedrock Edition clone using Three.js in a single HTML file is a complex task that would typically require a significant amount of code and resources. However, I can provide you with a simplified version that demonstrates basic 3D block rendering and player movement. This example will not include all the features of Minecraft but will give you a starting point.\n\nHere's a basic implementation:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Simple Minecraft Clone</title>\n    <style>\n        body { margin: 0; overflow: hidden; }\n        canvas { display: block; }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n        let scene, camera, renderer, controls;\n        const blocks = [];\n        const blockSize = 1;\n\n        function init() {\n            scene = new THREE.Scene();\n            camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);\n            renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true });\n            renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);\n            document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);\n\n            // Add basic lighting\n            const light = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 1);\n            light.position.set(5, 10, 7.5);\n            scene.add(light);\n            scene.add(new THREE.AmbientLight(0x404040));\n\n            // Create a simple ground\n            const groundGeometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(100, 100);\n            const groundMaterial = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({ color: 0x7cfc00 });\n            const ground = new THREE.Mesh(groundGeometry, groundMaterial);\n            ground.rotation.x = -Math.PI / 2;\n            scene.add(ground);\n\n            // Create blocks\n            for (let x = -5; x <= 5; x++) {\n                for (let z = -5; z <= 5; z++) {\n                    createBlock(x, 0, z);\n                }\n            }\n\n            camera.position.set(0, 5, 10);\n            camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0);\n\n            window.addEventListener('resize', onWindowResize, false);\n            document.addEventListener('keydown', onKeyDown, false);\n\n            animate();\n        }\n\n        function createBlock(x, y, z) {\n            const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(blockSize, blockSize, blockSize);\n            const material = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({ color: 0x8B4513 });\n            const block = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);\n            block.position.set(x * blockSize, y * blockSize, z * blockSize);\n            scene.add(block);\n            blocks.push(block);\n        }\n\n        function onWindowResize() {\n            camera.aspect = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight;\n            camera.updateProjectionMatrix();\n            renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);\n        }\n\n        function onKeyDown(event) {\n            const speed = 0.1;\n            switch (event.key) {\n                case 'w': // Move forward\n                    camera.position.z -= speed;\n                    break;\n                case 's': // Move backward\n                    camera.position.z += speed;\n                    break;\n                case 'a': // Move left\n                    camera.position.x -= speed;\n                    break;\n                case 'd': // Move right\n                    camera.position.x += speed;\n                    break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        function animate() {\n            requestAnimationFrame(animate);\n            renderer.render(scene, camera);\n        }\n\n        init();\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Three.js**: This code uses the Three.js library to create a 3D scene.\n- **Scene Setup**: A scene, camera, and renderer are created. Basic lighting is added to illuminate the blocks.\n- **Ground and Blocks**: A simple ground plane is created, and a grid of blocks is generated.\n- **Camera Movement**: Basic keyboard controls (`W`, `A`, `S`, `D`) allow the user to move the camera around the scene.\n- **Responsive Design**: The canvas resizes when the window is resized.\n\n### Limitations:\n- This is a very basic implementation and does not include many features of Minecraft, such as textures, crafting, inventory, or multiplayer.\n- The movement is not smooth and does not include gravity or jumping.\n- The blocks are not textured and are simply colored.\n\nYou can expand upon this code by adding more features, textures, and functionalities to create a more complete experience."
