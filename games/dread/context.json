Below is a basic web app structure that presents an interactive game with existential themes, embedded CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.\n\nYou can copy and paste the code below into a `.html` file and open it in your browser.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>The Existential Game</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            background-color: #121212;\n            color: #fff;\n            text-align: center;\n            padding: 50px;\n        }\n        button {\n            background-color: #3E50B4;\n            color: white;\n            border: none;\n            padding: 15px 25px;\n            cursor: pointer;\n            margin: 10px;\n            border-radius: 5px;\n            font-size: 16px;\n        }\n        button:hover {\n            background-color: #1A237E;\n        }\n        #story {\n            margin: 20px 0;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>The Existential Game</h1>\n    <div id=\"story\">You are at a crossroads in life.

It encourages users to think deeply about their life choices and implications. Feel free to expand upon the story, choices, and outcomes to create a richer experience!"
