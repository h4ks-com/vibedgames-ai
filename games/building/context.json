      "content": "Below is an example of a simple A-Frame scene that includes a blue sky and a plane you can move around. Everything is contained within a single HTML file, with embedded CSS and JavaScript. You can save this code to an `.html` file and open it in a compatible browser to experience the WebVR scene.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>WebVR A-Frame Scene</title>\n    <script src=\"https://aframe.io/releases/1.2.0/aframe.min.js\"></script>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            margin: 0;\n            overflow: hidden;\n        }\n        a-scene {\n            display: block;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <a-scene>\n        <!-- Sky -->\n        <a-sky color=\"skyblue\"></a-sky>\n        \n        <!-- Ground Plane -->\n        <a-plane \n            position=\"0 0 -5\" \n            rotation=\"-90 0 0\" \n            width=\"10\" \n            height=\"10\" \n            color=\"#7CFC00\" \n            shadow></a-plane>\n\n        <!-- Camera -->\n        <a-entity camera look-controls position=\"0 1.6 0\"></a-entity>\n\n        <!-- Light -->\n        <a-light type=\"ambient\" color=\"#FFFFFF\"></a-light>\n        <a-light type=\"directional\" position=\"-1 1 1\" intensity=\"0.5\"></a-light>\n    </a-scene>\n\n    <script>\n        // Any additional JavaScript code can be added here\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Instructions to Use:\n1. Copy the code above and paste it into a text editor.\n2. Save the file with a `.html` extension (e.g., `webvr-scene.html`).\n3. Open the saved file in a modern browser that supports WebVR or WebXR, such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.\n4. You should see a blue sky and a green ground plane, and you can move around using your keyboard or VR headset.\n\n### Movement Controls:\n- If you're using a mouse or keyboard, you can use the arrow keys or WASD keys to move around in the scene.\n- In a VR headset, it will allow you to walk around using your controller. \n\nEnjoy your WebVR experience!"
