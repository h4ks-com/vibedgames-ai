Since I don't have access to browse external URLs, I’ll create a sample collection of mom jokes for demonstration purposes. You can replace the jokes with any you prefer.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Random Mom Jokes</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            background-color: #f1f1f1;\n            display: flex;\n            justify-content: center;\n            align-items: center;\n            height: 100vh;\n            margin: 0;\n        }\n        .container {\n            text-align: center;\n            background-color: white;\n            padding: 20px;\n            border-radius: 10px;\n            box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n            max-width: 400px;\n        }\n        h1 {\n            font-size: 24px;\n            margin-bottom: 20px;\n        }\n        .joke {\n            font-size: 18px;\n            margin-bottom: 20px;\n        }\n        button {\n            padding: 10px 15px;\n            font-size: 16px;\n            cursor: pointer;\n            border: none;\n            border-radius: 5px;\n            background-color: #008CBA;\n            color: white;\n        }\n        button:hover {\n            background-color: #005f6b;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n    <h1>Random Mom Jokes</h1>\n    <div class=\"joke\" id=\"joke\">Click the button for a joke!</div>\n    <button onclick=\"newJoke()\">Get Joke</button>\n</div>\n\n<script>\n    const jokes = [\n        \"I told my kids I was going to freeze their toys so they wouldn't have to share.

Feel free to replace the jokes in the array with your favorites!"
